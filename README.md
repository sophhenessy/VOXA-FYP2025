VOIXA-FYP2025

The repository contains my code for my Final Year Project. The aim of this project was to design and develop a prototype of an app, VOIXA, to foster community-driven marketing and improve customer insights for small and medium-sized enterprises in the Hospitality, and Travel industries.
